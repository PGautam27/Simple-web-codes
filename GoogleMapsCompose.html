    <h1>Google Maps Jetpack Compose</h1>
    <p>This application displays the map and you could roll up to the place that you wanna mark on. And once you mark it up. Even after the app is killed is stores the location becaused of cashed data.</p>
    <p>Google maps for compose came up recently at feb 2022. And there'll be much more to it in the upcoming months. We can also expect places autocomplete as a function like this Google map function.</p>
    <p>The concepts that I used: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean architecture</li>
